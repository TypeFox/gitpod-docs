# Workspaces

A Gitpod workspace can be created from any GitHub project, branch, issue or pull-request.
We are still working on supporting other plaftorms such as GitLab and Bitbucket.

A points to a certain git state and includes additional context, e.g. a GitHub Pull Request or an Issue.
Given that information Gitpod can start a workspace in the cloud. 

By doing so it provides you with a full Linux container containing the checked out Git state.
You can further configure your workspace using .gitpod files. How this is done is explained [here](./3_0_Configuration).
